Part 1: Can Dogecoin Reach $100?
Short Answer: Extremely unlikely before 2040, if ever.

Key Reasons:
Market Cap Reality:
Current Dogecoin supply: ~148.5B coins
100/DOGE→100/DOGE→14.85T market cap (Bitcoin's current cap: $1.2T)

Requires 12x of Bitcoin's current value for a meme coin

Inflationary Supply:
5B new Dogecoin minted annually (3.3% inflation)
Unlike Bitcoin's fixed 21M supply
Utility Limitations:
No smart contract functionality
Primarily used for tipping/payments rather than store of value
